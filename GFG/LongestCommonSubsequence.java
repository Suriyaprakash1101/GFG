Longest Common Subsequence
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 41.68%Submissions: 309K+Points: 4
Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "ABE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE".

Examples:

Input: s1 = "ABCDGH", s2 = "AEDFHR"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR" is "ADH", which has a length of 3.
Input: s1 = "ABC", s2 = "AC"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABC" and "AC" is "AC", which has a length of 2.
Input: s1 = "XYZW", s2 = "XYWZ"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequences of "XYZW" and "XYWZ" are "XYZ" and "XYW", both of length 3.
Constraints:
1<= s1.size(), s2.size() <=103
Both strings s1 and s2 contain only uppercase English letters.
